# Introduction

A Simple Journal App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so anyone can sign up, customize & personalize their own content. This app allows user to login in remotely and submit journal entries that provide specific data for each posting. The user is also able to edit their posts whenever they'd like to.
